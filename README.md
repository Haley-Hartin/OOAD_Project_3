2. Notes

   * There are 3 output files for this assignment. Each for the 30, 45, 60 inventory level. They will be titled output_Inventory_##.txt
   * results for the JUnit Tests can be found at the bottom of each of the 3 output files

3. Assumptions Made

   * The randomness probability of something being chosen (i.e. how many customers per customer type, number of extras etc.) is assumed to be equally probable across the entire required domain.
   * As per the reading in the document "Casual customers will buy 1 to 3 rolls (type determined randomly)." This has been determined to mean that each of the 1-3 rolls will have a randomly determined type (i.e. a Casual customer will order a 2 rolls and the roll types are an Egg Roll and Spring Roll). This is assumed that this reading will also allow for the Casual customer to order 2+ of the same roll type (i.e. a casual customer orders 3 rolls and the types are 2 Pastry Rolls and 1 Sausage roll).
